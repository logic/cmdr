cmdr - commands, positional arguments, and variables for Go programs
====================================================================

cmdr wraps the Go standard library `flag` package to make it easy to add
subcommands, positional arguments, and environment variable triggers to
command-line programs.

cmdr is unable, and interfaces are likely to change without notice. You might
be better served with another library at this point if interface stability is
important to you.
